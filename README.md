# ecommerce-beta
<h3>This is the first ecommerce website i've made and so if there's any error then please let me know.</h3>
<p>The main page is a product landing page so it will allow the user to explore the website. Then as you go down, there're three items
displayed and it will take them to the produect detail page.</p>
<h4>The page is created with only html, css & js so there isn't any other login form and the checkout button will not be availble becasue it isn't linked with paypal 
or any other payment methods.</h4>
<p>once you're in the product description page, it will have the the product picture and along with the drop down menu so it will allow the user to pick the size that will fit them.</p>
<h4>However, you can also type in the amount that will like to purchase as well, but like i said becuase the website its on beta so the add to cart button will not work.
But you're allowed to change the product view so it will change to different view of the product.</h4>
<p>Lastly, i've also added the cookie section so it will save the user's input. Enjoy the website!</p>
